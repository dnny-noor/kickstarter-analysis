# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Our objective in this project is to perform various analyses and uncover trends within a historical dataset of 4,000 kickstarter campaigns and giving detailed reports to the client, Louise, to make informed decisions on starting her own campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of theater outcomes by launch date was done by a pivot table where a count of each outcome was collected of the month the launch date occurred. Each month was summed up to get the total amount of campaigns. The table was translated to a line chart that plotted each count of outcome throughout the months. This allows us to follow the campaigns and how their success was trending throughout the year and show when the majority of campaigns would start.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outcomes based on goals took a monetary approach to find information on the success of campaigns. A table was created with goal amount breakdown into ranges and each successful, failed, and canceled outcome was counted and summed up. From these counts, the percentage was calculated on each outcome. These percentages were plotted onto a line chart and displayed a comparison of all the goal ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges with working on the project came from creating the charts from the tables. Using the default recommended settings of the Excel insert chart function, generated additional data points that were not necessary for the outcomes based on goals chart. This took some trail and error to remove the additional columns and formatting the table design to make the visual legible through the design and format tabs of the chart tools.

## Results
- *What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*
The middle of the year from April to August had the greatest number of successful campaigns compared to the rest of the months. This also is the period where the most campaigns were launched. The number of successful outcomes takes a decline going through the back end of the year. The number of failed outcomes remained fairly consistent throughout the year staying in between 31 and 52 failed campaigns.

- *What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*
The greater percentage of successful play campaigns happened with goals of $4,999 or less. The majority had goals of $14,999 or less and will provide a better overview than outcomes that had goals above this amount.

- *What are some limitations of this dataset?*
The dataset has a good sample size for the $1,000 to $4,999 compared to the other ranges. With a lower sample size on the other ranges, the percentages will not be a reliable data point source for analysis and cannot give a definite probability of success or failure. The dataset also does not tell what aspects the funding was to be used for, such as more funding needed to acquire a building or major purchase. If aspects of the budget were given, the dataset could have been redistributed to have a more one to one goal comparison.

- *What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*
Some other tables and graphs can be created to present more details. A table containing calculations of the length of time that successful campaigns had versus the time that of failed ones had and determine if there is a correlation with length time and outcome. A bar chart where the outcomes are grouped by the goal amount range and displaying the time length of each would show the appropriate amount of time needed to have a successful campaign. Another analysis that can be done is having a simple table that will group by category and subcategory and summing the number of backers of each group. A line chart can track the number of backers throughout the years in each category to show the popularity trend.
