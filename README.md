Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Through Excel, a collection of kickstarter campaigns data was analyzed by performing statistical calculations and charting to find commonality amongst specified categories, location, and outcomes. A wide variety of data was grouped together by specific type of event and genre. Filtering by the country gave insight to types of trends that occur throughtout the year which helps us understand where a campaign will have the greater chance of being successful or non-successful.

Theater appears to be the most popular of the events and has a great number of successful fundraising campaigns but it also has the greatest number for failures.

Based on the number of outcomes throughout the year, campaigns were more successful at the beginning of the year and starts to take a downward trend after May.
