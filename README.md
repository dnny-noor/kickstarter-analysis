Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Through Excel, a collection of kickstarter campaigns data was analyzed by performing statistical calculations and charting to find commonality amongst specified categories, location, and outcomes. A wide variety of data was grouped together by specific type of event and genre. Filtering by the country gave insight to types of trends that occur throughtout the year which helps us understand where a campaign will have the greater chance of being successful or non-successful.
